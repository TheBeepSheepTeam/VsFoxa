# Description
* This is the document that shows you how to use the Stage Editor.
Sorry for the shitty English in the editor. I took this editor from another engine.
Also, we have kinda changed how the stage assets work just a little bit, so your stages may break iirc.

# Setup
1. Go to the `Data` tab.
2. Edit the `Stage Directory`, it's for the stage assets folder. ("week1" is "assets/week1/images")

These should be done before the main part of the tutorial.

# How to use the Stage Editor!
## Step 1 - Adding an Image
1. Go to the `Asset` tab.
2. Type an image name (without the .png extension) in `Image Name`.
3. You can adjust image settings down there.
4. And Press ``Add Image``.
Done!

## Step 2 - Adding an Animated Image
1. Go to the `Animation` tab.
2. Type your animated image name in `Animation File`.
3. Adjust settings on the right. (if you want)
4. Press `Add Sprite`.
5. Now type your animation texture name, it must be in your .xml file.
6. And press `Add Animation`.

## Step 3 - Adjusting your Character
1. Go to the `Characters` tab.
2. Press `Character Edit Mode`.
3. Press A/D to swap characters.

## Step 4 - Loading your Stage Asset File
1. Go to the `Data` tab.
2. Type in `Data File Name` and press `Load Data` to load your Stage Asset data File.
